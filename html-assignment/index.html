        A little about me. My birthday is January 18<sup>th</sup> so I'm a
        Capricorn. I enjoy playing
        <em>hockey, soccer, and lacrosse.</em>

        I've always enjoyed art. In highschool I grew to love photography and
        media design.

      <p>
        Last year I was in Mobile Application Design and Developpment. It helped
        me realize how much I like web design and how I'd rather be in a field
        geared more to web design and media design rather than programing.
