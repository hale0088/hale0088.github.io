      <h2>About me</h2>

        A little about me. My birthday is January 18<sup>th</sup> so I'm a
        Capricorn. I enjoy playing
        <em>hockey, soccer, and lacrosse.</em>

        I've always enjoyed art. In highschool I grew to love photography and
        media design. Last year I was in Mobile Application Design and
        Developpment. It helped me realize how much I like web design.
